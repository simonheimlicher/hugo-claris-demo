How does a startup turn into a corporate behemoth with layers upon layers of policies, processes and rules? It happens one mistake that must never be made again at a time. But as Kevin Kruse in [Great Leaders Have No Rules]() says, every rule takes away an opportunity to make a choice. 

> As for empowerment, I simply hate that word...
> What I came to understand deeply and in a new way once I made my way into the scrappier start-up world is that people have power. A company’s job isn’t to empower people; it’s to remind people that they walk in the door with power and to create the conditions for them to exercise it. Do that, and you will be astonished by the great work they will do for you.
