In his widely acclaimed book, L. David Marquet outlines in an autobiographic way his path from a leader that leads followers to a leader that creates more leaders.

The book [Turn the Ship Around!](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591846404?ie=UTF8&tag=shzq-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=1591846404) is worth reading cover-to-cover. While it has a tremendous breadth and exposes the topic skillfully, there is one sequence that summarizes the entire problem that is addressed by the [Intent-Based leadership](https://intentbasedleadership.com/) approach introduced in this book:

> The captain ordered, “ahead two-thirds.” The officer on deck repeated the order, “ahead two-thirds.”
>
> Nothing happened.
>
> Captain Marquet noticed the helmsman who was to execute the order looked unsettled. When asked what the problem was, the helmsman pointed out that there was no two-thirds in the electric propulsion mode unlike all his previous submarines. When asked, the officer on deck said he repeated the command knowing it was wrong.
> 
> David realized that the leader-follower environment meant his crew would do anything he said—even if it was wrong.
