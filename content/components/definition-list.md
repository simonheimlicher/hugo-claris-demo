Connected

: a network is called *connected* if it permanently provides paths between all nodes.

Disconnected

: Otherwise, it is referred to as *disconnected*. 

Partially connected

: If a disconnected network provides physical paths between a sizable fraction of nodes, we say it is *partially connected,* as opposed to a scenario where all nodes are isolated almost all the time.
