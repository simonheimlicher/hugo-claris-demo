The built-in Cisco VPN client introduced in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard has the habit of disconnecting itself when re-keying should be performed but fails after about 48 minutes up to one hour. This timeout issue has been fixed in Mac OS X 10.6.4.

In versions of Mac OS X 10.6.0 up to 10.6.3, the problem can be worked around by increasing the re-keying period to e.g. 1 week. 

{{% note tip %}}
The update to Snow Leopard 10.6.4 fixes the issue of the VPN disconnecting after 48 minutes many people have observed in 10.6.0â€“10.6.3. Therefore, there is no need to change the configuration of `racoon` anymore.

In order to revert your configuration to the stock one, remove the last line from `/etc/racoon.conf`, so that the last line is again

``` plain
include "/var/run/racoon/*.conf" ;
```
{{% /note %}}

**Note that this workaround severely decreases the security of your VPN connection as attackers now have up to 1 week to attack the phase 1 key**.

I have no clue where Apple stores the configuration template for `racoon`, but I have found the following workaround.

1. Create directory "/etc/racoon/remote" as root:

``` plain
sudo mkdir /etc/racoon/remote
```

2. Open a VPN connection to your Cisco VPN concentrator. This should result in the creation of a config file located at `/var/run/racoon/10.1.1.1.conf`, where `10.1.1.1` is the IP address of the VPN concentrator.

3. Move this dynamically created file to `/etc/racoon/remote` before we change its contents:

``` plain
sudo mv /var/run/racoon/*.conf /etc/racoon/remote
```


4. Now we edit the file, replacing all lines

``` plain
lifetime time 3600 sec;
```
by

``` plain
lifetime time 168 hours;
```

This is achieved by the following `sed` command:

``` plain
sudo sed -i.bak 's/lifetime time 3600 sec/lifetime time 168 hours/' /etc/racoon/remote/*.conf
```

1. To make `racoon` read our converted file, insert a line

``` plain
include "/etc/racoon/remote/*.conf" ;
```
right before the last line of `/etc/racoon.conf`. The last two lines should now be

``` plain
include "/etc/racoon/remote/*.conf" ;
include "/var/run/racoon/*.conf" ;
```
This is achieved by executing the following patch command:
``` plain
sudo patch /etc/racoon/racoon.conf <<EOF

+include "/etc/racoon/remote/*.conf" ;
 include "/var/run/racoon/*.conf" ;

```

1. Restart racoon:

``` plain
sudo launchctl stop com.apple.racoon
sudo launchctl start com.apple.racoon
```

That's it. If this did not do the trick, try restarting your machine.

To summarize, here are all the commands to be executed:

``` bash
sudo mkdir /etc/racoon/remote
sudo mv /var/run/racoon/*.conf /etc/racoon/remote
sudo sed -i.bak 's/lifetime time 3600 sec/lifetime time 168 hours/' /etc/racoon/remote/*.conf
